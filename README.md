# Personal Portfolio


**Hey there! Welcome to this corner of the repository. Let me drive you through my Personal Portfolio website in a glimpse and tell you what techologies i've used!!**

*So lets get started!!!!*


I developed my personal portfolio website using React.js to showcase my skills as a *Frontend Developer.*

When building the website, I focused on creating a dynamic, component-based architecture using React.js. ensuring <u>scalability and maintainability</u>, used <u>reusable components</u> to improve efficiency and keeping the codebase clean. Incorporated React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state and handle API calls, enabling smooth user interactions and dynamic content.

Aiming for a clean, minimal design, I applied my CSS skills to design a responsive and visually appealing layout and implemented <u>media queries</u> to ensure my portfolio looks great on any screen size. 

Deploying is where I gained experience in <u>web hosting and continuous integration</u> tools. Seeing my portfolio live and accessible was rewarding, and it allowed me to present my skills in a polished, professional manner. 

This project was a great opportunity to demonstrate my ability to build a user-friendly, performant web application from start to finish.
